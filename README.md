# Prompt-Images-to-GPT
Communicate to GPT with videos and images before public released


GPT-4 is really exciting!!! But before you are off the long long waitlist. What if you want to try the cool function like prompt images to GPT and get an interactive website back? 

Here is a little trick I have tried:

Just as simple as using the already published model engine!!! Executed by the cute bot on Discord.

Totally inspired by the official presentation here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=outcGtbnMuQ&t=442

**The notice is that "text-davinci-003" is really dumb and unstable than the awesome GPT-4 model, so here's just a taste of multimedia interaction with GPT regardless of accuracy. Have fun!!!**
